This project was made as an case for fullstack interview with a 72 hours deadline. I learned MongoDB with mongoose, user auth in react together with firebase.

# BEFORE USING
For safety reasons, as of now, you need to run a local server for demo to work. Instructions are provided below
**[DEMO](https://cardealer-case.netlify.com/)**

# Instructions
## Download Project
Firstly, download the projects zip-folder from my [GitHUB SOURCE](https://github.com/jFrisks/cardealer-fullstack)
Place it in any directory on your computer.


## Install NODE
If you don't have NODE installed, please [download](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) it and install it with the installer file.

### Do I have NODE?
If you are not sure if you have installed node correctly, open up your terminal and run the commando **npm -v**

## Prepare Project
Open up your terminal and use the command **cd PROJECT_FOLDER_PATH** to get into the project. When in the folder **PROJECT_PATH/cardealer-fullstack/backend/src** write command **npm install** in the terminal. This will install all required dependencies for everything to work.

## Run Local Server
When all dependencies are installed, we will start the server. Ensure you are in the **PROJECT_PATH/cardealer-fullstack/backend/src**. Run command **node server.js** to start the server. The terminal window will tell that "Server is up and running on port:  8080
[...]"

We can now start the frontend client.

## Start the front end CLIENT
In Chrome, open up **[DEMO](https://cardealer-case.netlify.com/)**
You should hopefully see both the client running and see data
